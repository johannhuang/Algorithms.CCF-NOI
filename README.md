# Introduction

CCF NOI stands for China Computer Federation National Olympiad in Informatics.

This repository contains algorithms implemented in C when I was in high school from 2008 to 2011. These algorithms were originally written in Dev-C++ either for learning the basics of programming in C and algorithms or as solutions for questions of CCF NOI.

After almost 13 years since I wrote my first line of the code and more than 10 years of having all the code on my hard drive, with some spare time now, I think I can take some time to make the code useful again. Be it for me re-learning C or for others who may want to reference my implementation.
